This repo contains working code for the example in O'Reilly's _Programming Android, 2nd Edition_;  Mednieks, Dornin, Meike, Nakamura (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023005.do)

The projects have all been tested in eclipse, using the emulator (with the exception of a couple that are hardware dependent; those projects have notes to that effect in their README files)
